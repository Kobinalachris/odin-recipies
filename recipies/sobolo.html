        <li>1 Pineapple</li>
        <li>2 large thumbs - 1/3 cup of ginger peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup dates pitted</li>
        <li>Sugar to taste</li>
        <li>15 grains of selim</li>
        <li>7 African nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cloves</li>
        <li>2 dried chillies</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black pepercorn</li>
        <li>1 tbsp grains of paradise</li>
        <li>2 cups hibiscus</li>
        <li>16 cups of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the pineapple by soaking in a water and vinegar solution for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>While the pineapple is soaking, soak the dates in warm water then drain when nice and soft</li>
        <li>Pluck a few leaves from the pineapple crown and peel the pineapple</li>
        <li>Cut the pineapple fruit in chunks removing the core</li>
        <li>In a blender, blend the pineapple fruit with the ginger, spices and dates till smooth</li>
        <li>In a pot, add the pineapple leaves, skin, blended mixture, and spices with 10 cups of water and bring to a boil. Do not cover the pot otherwise it will splash</li>
        <li>One the water has come to a boil, add the sorrel and bring the heat down to allow the mixture to steep at a rolling boil</li>
        <li>Let it steep for at least 30 minutes, then turn off the stove</li>
        <li>Add sugar to taste, I added ~ 3/4 cup of brown sugar, adding 1/4 at a time and tasting to make sure I was getting the right sweetness</li>
        <li>Let it cool till the drink is completely cool (room temperature)</li>
        <li>Strain drink with a fine mesh strainer. if you have the energy, you can also use a nut milk bag to really get all the bits.</li>
        <li>Bottle and keep in the fridge</li>
    </ol>
